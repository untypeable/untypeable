<h1>Welcome to my github</h1>
<br>
<p>Nothing of real value is stored here. All of my things for work or commisioned programs are private</p>
<p>If you are here saying "making that isn't hard" then yes, you're right.</p>
<p>Programming I do is just for fun, not as a challenge</p>
<br>
<p>If you are my boss/have been sent here to download something, projects under development can be found under 'work-projects' repository</p>
<p>If you do not have access, message me using my WORK email, not the one below</p>
